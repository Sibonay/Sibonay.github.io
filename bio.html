	<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
	<h2> I'm Sibonay, a sophomore at Tufts University studying English and Computer Science.</h2>
	<p>
		Originally from Singapore, I now live in the beautiful (often snow-covered) city of Boston. My childhood bookshelf was filled with fantasy and sci-fi books, and Onion News inspired me to create a fake satirical newspaper when I was eight. I never expected to do Computer Science, but I discovered a new passion when, on a whim, I took the introductory class this year. You can find me dancing Ballroom, Street Latin, or Country Swing six days a week. I also enjoy painting, photography, improv, creative writing, playing the piano, and eating Asian food.
