Personal website of Sibonay Koo
NOTE: NEW UPDATED WEBSITE COMING SOON! THIS WAS MY FIRST ATTEMPT EVER AT HTML AND CSS, AND I REALISE IT HAS MANY FLAWS

1) Includes index page, bio (about me) page, and resume
   Conforms to HTML5 standards
   All styling done in CSS - no HTML styling frameworks

   Errors when passed through CSS validator
   	e.g. Parse error for filter:alpha(opacity=50)
   	     --> this is a non-standard property so does not validate
2) assisted by Ming Chow (helped with debugging)
3) Hours spent on project: ~10
